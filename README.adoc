This is a small library implementing PID file locks. Those are files with
process identifier stored inside and locks protecting their consistency and
access. The usage of such file ensures that only one instance of some program is
running at the same time. It also allows identification of that instance thanks
to the PID file.

The implementation supports access to lock by multiple users. The only
requirement is write permission on the directory where PID lock file is created.
It also supports automatic recovery after fatal crash of lock holder.

The code uses Unix flocks and thus currently only supported platform is
compatible Unix.
